# Nix Merch

This contains a collection of 3D-printable nixOS merch using the NixOS-Flake logo.
The logo [originally](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-homepage/commit/d5af1e3971822b8a3ec19689a17464558baf7244) designed by [Simon Frankau](https://arbitrary.name/) (@simon-frankau) and revised by [Tim Cuthbertson](https://gfxmonk.net/) (@timbertson).
It has been downloaded from [here](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-artwork/tree/master/logo) and has been made available under a [CC-BY license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

 It has been further edited in order to make it printable by me.

Currently there is the basic logo, a key-chain and a bike spoke. The last one has not been tested and might not work depending on the bike.
